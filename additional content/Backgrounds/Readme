--- Readme for the 'Fan-made Additions' folder ----

This folder contains a number of scripts that can be used to add extra content to MPMB's Character Record Sheet. These are scripts made by MPMB or others for third-party materials (i.e. not from Wizards of the Coast)

You can do this by following these steps:
1) Open a fresh instance of the latest version of MPMB's Character Record Sheet (found here: http://flapkan.com/mpmb/dmsguild).
2) Click on the bookmark "Add User Script", or go to the 'JavaScript window', click on "Im/Export" and select "Add user script" from the menu. This should open a dialogue. 
3) Open the .js file in a text editor (e.g. Notepad/TextEdit).
4) Copy the entire content of the file to the dialogue and press "Add Script".

>> Note that you can add as many scripts as you want, simply add the script to the text you see in the dialogue.

>> Be sure to add any scripts you want to use before actually filling out the sheet. Adding a script might cause fields to be reset.

>> Each of the files in this folder has comments at the start with information on what the file offers, who made the content, and (if possible) a link to the original content. As always, the abbreviated content provided with these files is meant as a mnemonic and not a replacement for the full description.


You can create your own custom JavaScript to add stuff to MPMB's Character Record Sheet by following the syntax found here: http://flapkan.com/mpmb/syntax

If you decide to make extra content for the sheet, please consider sending me a copy (flapkan@gmail.com) so that I can put it on the "Fan-made Additions" Dropbox/GitHub. Please send your code in a .txt file as gmail has a tendency to remove .js attachments.

Good luck with adding extra content and have fun with the sheets!

Cheers,
