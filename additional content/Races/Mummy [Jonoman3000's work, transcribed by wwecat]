I do not dream in this state, but resting in this way is otherwise identical to sleeping. Magically induced sleep can cause me to enter this inactive state. \nAs an action, I can target one creature I can see within 10 feet of me. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of me until the end of my next turn. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + my Constitution modifier + my Proficiency bonus. \nMy hands rot those they touch. When I make unarmed attacks against creatures with them, I deal Necrotic damage equal to 1d4 + my Str modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed attack.",
