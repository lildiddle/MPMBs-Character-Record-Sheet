I do not dream in this state, but resting in this way is otherwise identical to sleeping. Magically induced sleep can cause me to enter this inactive state. \nWhen I kill a humanoid, I can choose to have it rise 24 hours later as a zombie under my control, unless it is restored to life or its body is destroyed.n\Only one zombie may be created through this ability at any one time, if another is created then the first becomes inanimate.n\The zombie has the statistics of the Zombie (Monster Manual pg. 316), except its hp value is instead equal to three times my level.",
