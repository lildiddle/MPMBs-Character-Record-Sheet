/*  -INFORMATION-
    Subject:    Companions
    Effect:     This script adds the Companions for a class called "Dragon Knight"
     
                This is taken from a google drive PDF (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4DXaYGyECU5UzE0eHMxME42Qmc/view)
                This class and subclasses are made by u/Rain-Junkie
    Code by:    lildiddle
    Date:       2017-12-15
    
        You do not need to copy all of the following companions down, and doing so will freeze your adobe for a long time. The companions are listed in the same order as the order in the official PDF.
	
	These companions also have a very large list of features and traits however many don't apply until the Dragon Knight reaches a certain level, while others stop applying at certain levels. Feel free to delete any features or traits that either don't apply anymore or won't apply for a while.
